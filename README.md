# UniMol

a project aiming to reproduce RasMol's functionnality with a factor of 100 computing efficiency using GPU acceleration with opengl, opengl and multithreading.

## Planned Features:
- GPU accelerated Rendering
- GPU accelerated Physics
- CPU multithreading for GPU-Less legacy systems
- well documented and extendable cross platform cross library source

## Current Features:
- nothing usable yet, just wait a bit ^^
